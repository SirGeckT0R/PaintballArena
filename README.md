Developed with Unreal Engine 5

"Paintball Arena" is a first–person shooter game with three-dimensional graphics, which is a free adaptation of the paintball sports game. The main character of the game can move around the arena, shoot paint from a gun – a paintball marker – to cope with opponents. Enemies attack the player in response, and when they hit him, they take away units of life. The number of opponents increases with each "wave". The number of "waves" is infinite, the game ends only when the player loses. The goal of the game is to score as many points as possible. 
The ranged opponent, like the player, uses a paintball marker. The enemy starts patrolling the playing field after appearing in the arena. When a player is detected (with the help of "sight", "hearing" or after receiving damage), one of them, all opponents on the level stop patrolling and start attacking the main character. The artificial intelligence finds the nearest shelter where it can hide from attacks, then shoots at the player and changes its location.
Another type of opponent is a melee fighter who uses a toy hammer instead of a marker. When it detects the player then tries to approach him and strike. In case of a miss, the enemy begins to circle around the main character, waiting for the right moment for a new attack. 
The rules of the game were designed, two types of opponents and artificial intelligence were invented for each of them, health and scoring systems were worked out. Developed types of opponents: ranged and melee fighter. One original animation of the player's weapon reloading has been created. The user interface of the game was developed, the visual representation of the game was designed.
